## Goal
Slice 6 part A, child card **A9** of T-172. Close the low notes of the review of PR #268 (D-370).

## Context (read only these)
- Plan: `docs/tasks/T-172-slice-6-plan.md` section "Plan" (until PR #272 is merged: `git show origin/pl-architect/T-172-slice-6-plan:docs/tasks/T-172-slice-6-plan.md`), decisions `docs/decisions/T-172.md` on the same branch (D-360 … D-375). Read row A9 of the child card table, the contracts, the risks and the decisions the row names.
- `AGENTS.md` "Autonomy and release" (D-326)

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Everything row A9 of the plan lists; touch only the files that row gives you. If you need another file, ask `pl-lead` first.
- [ ] ≤ ~80 lines without tests.
- [ ] No new token right. New decisions only with numbers from `pl-lead`, in `docs/decisions/T-183.md`.
- [ ] Tests: `make lint test` passes; `origin/main` merged; own worktree and branch; PR to `main`; pictures in a PR only from the mock (D-375); report to `pl-lead`.

## Out of scope
- Everything of other rows. Part B (waits for the user). Any release step.
